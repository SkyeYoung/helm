# Kubito Helm Charts for Kubernetes

This repository acts like a helm chart repository for various Kubernetes applications, packaged by Kubito.

## TL;DR

```bash
helm repo add kubitodev https://charts.kubito.dev
helm search repo kubitodev
helm install example kubitodev/<chart>
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages. You can then run `helm search repo
kubitodev` to see the charts.

To uninstall the chart:

```bash
helm uninstall example kubitodev/<chart>
```
